                <li> A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. The word is derived from the
                    ancient Greek term "gymnasion". They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as
                    activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.</li>

                    originally started by Joe Gold in Venice Beach, California. </li>
                <li> A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may
                    leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious.</li>

            <li><span> Step 1 — Pick a Goal:</span> If this is your first workout program, or you don’t have much
                experience, you’ll see the most benefits from an outlined plan. Rest assured — this is applicable for
                any gymgoer regardless of their knowledge. Knowing what you want to tackle is one of the first major
                steps.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Step 2 — Choose a Workout Split:</span> Now that you have your goals in mind, center on a workout
                split, which is how you split up all the work you do over a period of time — usually a week. </li>
            <br>
            <li><span>Step 3 — Select Your Exercises:</span> With your goals and split established, it’s time to pick
                specific exercises. Every exercise you choose should be in service of whatever your goals are and
                suitable for your body type. There should be no wasted space. </li>

            <br>
            <li><span>Step 4 — Organize Your Workouts:</span> Each of your workouts ought to begin with your compound
                movements because of the high energy they require. Then, depending on the day’s tasks, you’ll follow up
                with supportive, tailored accessory movements. As a general rule, begin with those lifts that recruit
                more muscles and require more attention before shifting to smaller, isolated movements.</li>
            <li><span>Step 5 — Select Sets and Reps :
                </span>The number of sets and reps you perform in a given exercise largely dictates how it affects your
                body. If you’re aiming at more strength, lower reps per set with higher weight will yield more gains.
                Conversely, dropping the weight down and performing more reps overall will help your muscular and
                cardiovascular endurance.</li>
            <li><span>Step 6 — Consider Your Rest:</span> As much as you have to rest post-workout, you also have to
                rest between your sets. Structured resting periods often separate good workout plans from great ones.
